# Uncommon Dart Bug: Incorrect Error Handling in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error handling pattern in Dart involving asynchronous operations and provides a corrected version.

The original code (`bug.dart`) showcases how improper error handling can lead to unexpected behavior. The improved version (`bugSolution.dart`) demonstrates best practices for handling errors in asynchronous scenarios.

## Bug Description

The `bug.dart` file contains a function that fetches data from a remote API.  It correctly checks for HTTP success, but the error handling in the `catch` block could be improved.  The current implementation simply prints the error to the console, which isn't ideal for production applications. A more robust approach would include logging, user feedback, or retry mechanisms.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a refined solution with enhanced error handling.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `bug.dart` file.  Simulate a failed network request (e.g., by disconnecting from the internet) to observe the error handling.
3. Run the `bugSolution.dart` file to observe the improved error handling.
